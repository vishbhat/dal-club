The project is about developing an online web application for DALClub to be able to move their business online and to increase the availability and efficiency of the business processes. The DALClub is a private club in Halifax that offers a variety of social events and networking opportunities, as well as sophisticated and casual food selections. The Club is a place for people to experience elegant comfort while socializing with other guests, or while conducting business meetings. Through this application, the customers can easily understand and register for the activities for the club online, and the admins can smoothly manage these entities from their end. Thus, it is not required for the customers to physically visit the club to know any information, book any event or purchase any merchandise, and the admins also have total control over the application with a UI that is simple and easy to navigate.
